# 🐍 Python Beginner Exercises - Day 1 & 2 Solutions

This repository contains the solutions to Python exercises covering fundamental programming concepts, including basic arithmetic, user input handling, conditional logic, and looping structures.

## 📁 Project Contents

The repository includes two Jupyter Notebooks with exercises and their complete solutions:

### **`Python_Day_1_Exercises_Solutions.ipynb`**

This notebook focuses on basic data types, arithmetic operations, and user input:

* **User Input and String Formatting:** Creating personalized greetings and accepting user input for name and age.
* **Area and Cost Calculation:** Measuring and calculating floor areas and total costs for tile installation.
* **Temperature Conversion:** Converting temperature units from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
* **Distance Conversion:** Implementing two versions for converting distances between miles and kilometres.
* **Digit Manipulation (Floor Division & Modulus):** Specifically extracting and summing digits from a 3-digit number.
* **Digit Reversal:** Reversing the digits of a 4-digit number to generate a "secret code."

### **`Python_Day_2_Exercises_Solutions.ipynb`**

This notebook concentrates on control flow, decision-making, and iteration:

* **Conditional Statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`):** Using conditional statements to control program flow, such as building a basic user authentication for a security door access system.
* **Modulus Operator (`%`):** Applying the modulus operator for checking number properties like divisibility by 3 and 7.
* **`while` Loops:** Implementing a simple calculator with a menu that uses a `while` loop to repeat tasks until an "Exit" condition is met.
* **`for` Loops and `range()`:** Practicing the `for` loop with the `range()` function to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 up to a chosen number.
* **Prime Number Check:** Combining loops and decision-making logic to determine if a number is prime.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run these notebooks, you will need:

* **Python 3** (The code uses Python 3 syntax).
* **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab** (e.g., installed via Anaconda or Miniconda).
* **Google Colab** (You can also open the `.ipynb` files directly in Google Colab).

## 🚀 How to Run


 **Open the files:** Select either `Python_Day_1_Exercises_Solutions.ipynb` or `Python_Day_2_Exercises_Solutions.ipynb` from the Jupyter file browser to view and execute the code cells.
